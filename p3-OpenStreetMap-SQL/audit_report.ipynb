If they're not eating, they're at parked at the bank to withdraw money, possibly used for future eating. Or they could be found at the pharmancy, possibly refilling perscription medication for various diseases related to overeating.

If that's the case, I'm going to assume that a lot of restaurants are missing from this dataset; meaning the data is incomplete. Since restaurants constantly change, I'll also make the assumption that the dataset may be out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are only 509 contributors for the Markham dataset; 26.7% of which are one time contributors. Before this project, I've never even heard of OpenStreetMap. Word of this awesome application needs to spread! \n",

    "Hmm, I guess since I learned of the app from Udacity, more people should just enroll to this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or perhaps OpenStreetMap needs to gain access to data like Yelp to update its restaurant list. My suggestion would then be an Open source Yelp to help with Open Source Street Mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.0 Conclusion\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the dataset was not completely accurate, OpenStreetMap demonstrates the beauty in people coming together in providing a map that is compeletely free to use. With all data that is user generated, there were bound to be errors within the entries. With the techniques I've gained through Udacity's data wrangling course, I was able to programmatically correct some of those entries and generate a couple of neat facts using the SQL database on the City of Markham, Ontario.\n",
